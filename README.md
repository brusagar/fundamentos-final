# Relations and NER NLP Application

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up the Relations and NER NLP application with SpERT integration from scratch.

## Overview

This application is a **Textual-based GUI** for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction using **SpERT** (Span-based Entity and Relation Transformer). It provides an interactive terminal interface that can also run in your browser.

### Key Features
- **Textual GUI**: Modern terminal-based interface with browser support
- **SpERT Integration**: State-of-the-art span-based entity and relation extraction
- **Training Pipeline**: Custom model training with your own data
- **Interactive Prediction**: Real-time analysis and visualization
- **Data Management**: Built-in tools for data preprocessing and annotation
- **Multi-Environment**: Separate environments for main app and SpERT to avoid conflicts

**If just interested in visualization, I recommend creating the folder spert/data/model_predictions/ and moving the ./test_predictions.json there.**

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** (Python 3.11 recommended)
- **Git**
- **Terminal/Command Line Access**

```

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone This Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brusagar/fundamentos-final.git
cd fundamentos-final
```

### 2. Set Up SpERT (For Training/Prediction)

```bash
# Clone SpERT framework (separate from main repo)
git clone https://github.com/lavis-nlp/spert.git
cd spert

# Create SpERT environment
python -m venv .spert_env
source .spert_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: .spert_env\Scripts\activate

# Install custom SpERT dependencies
pip install -r ./requirements-spert.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

# Return to main project
deactivate
cd ..
```

### 3. Set Up Main Application

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## Running the Application

### Method 1: Browser Interface (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
# Activate main app environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Serve in browser (opens automatically)
textual serve app/app.py

```

### Method 2: Terminal Interface
```bash
# Activate main app environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run in terminal
textual run app/app.py
```

### Method 3: Direct Python Execution
```bash
# Activate main app environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run directly
python app/app.py
```

## SpERT Configuration and Usage

### Creating Configuration Files

The application expects SpERT configuration files in `spert/configs/`. Create these files for your specific use case:

**Training Configuration (`spert/configs/argonauts_config_train.conf`):**
```properties
label = relation_train
model_type = spert
model_path = bert-base-cased
tokenizer_path = bert-base-cased
train_path = data/train.json
valid_path = data/dev.json
types_path = data/types.json 
train_batch_size = 2
eval_batch_size = 2
neg_entity_count = 100
neg_relation_count = 100
epochs = 2
lr = 3e-5
lr_warmup = 0.1
weight_decay = 0.01
max_grad_norm = 1.0
rel_filter_threshold = 0.4
size_embedding = 25
prop_drop = 0.1
max_span_size = 10
store_predictions = true
store_examples = true
sampling_processes = 1
max_pairs = 1000
final_eval = true
log_path = data/log/
save_path = data/save/
no_overlapping = true
```

**Prediction Configuration (`spert/configs/argonauts_predict.conf`):**
```properties
model_type = spert
model_path = data/save/relation_train/[TIMESTAMP]/final_model
tokenizer_path = data/save/relation_train/[TIMESTAMP]/final_model
dataset_path = data/raw_text.json
types_path = data/types.json
predictions_path = data/predictions.json
spacy_model = en_core_web_sm
eval_batch_size = 1
rel_filter_threshold = 0.4
size_embedding = 25
prop_drop = 0.1
max_span_size = 10
sampling_processes = 4
max_pairs = 1000
```

### Manual Training and Prediction (Optional)

The application handles training and prediction through its GUI, but you can also run SpERT manually:

```bash
# Switch to SpERT environment
cd spert
source .spert_env/bin/activate

# Train a model
python spert.py train --config configs/argonauts_config_train.conf

# Make predictions
python spert.py predict --config configs/argonauts_predict.conf

# Return to main app
deactivate
cd ..
```

## Data Requirements and Format

### Required Data Files

For SpERT training and prediction, ensure you have these files in your `spert/data/` directory:

- **`train.json`** - Training data in SpERT format
- **`dev.json`** - Validation data for training
- **`test.json`** - Test data for evaluation
- **`types.json`** - Entity and relation type definitions
- **`raw_text.json`** - Raw text for prediction (generated by app)

### Data Format Examples

**Entity and Relation Types (`spert/data/types.json`):**
```json
{
  "entities": [
    {"type": "PERSON", "short": "PER", "verbose": "Person names"},
    {"type": "LOCATION", "short": "LOC", "verbose": "Geographic locations"},
    {"type": "ORGANIZATION", "short": "ORG", "verbose": "Organizations"},
    {"type": "EVENT", "short": "EVT", "verbose": "Historical events"}
  ],
  "relations": [
    {"type": "located_in", "short": "located_in", "verbose": "Spatial relation"},
    {"type": "works_for", "short": "works_for", "verbose": "Employment relation"},
    {"type": "part_of", "short": "part_of", "verbose": "Part-whole relation"}
  ]
}
```

**Training Data Example (`spert/data/train.json`):**
```json
[
  {
    "tokens": ["John", "works", "for", "Google", "in", "California"],
    "entities": [
      {"type": "PERSON", "start": 0, "end": 1},
      {"type": "ORGANIZATION", "start": 3, "end": 4},
      {"type": "LOCATION", "start": 5, "end": 6}
    ],
    "relations": [
      {"type": "works_for", "head": 0, "tail": 1},
      {"type": "located_in", "head": 1, "tail": 2}
    ]
  }
]
```

### Using the Application's Data Tools

The application includes built-in tools for:
- **Text Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare raw text data
- **Entity Search**: Find and annotate entities using gazetteers

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**❌ `textual` command not found**
```bash
# Solution: Use Python module syntax
python -m textual serve app/app.py
python -m textual run app/app.py
```

**❌ Import errors or module not found**
```bash
# Check you're in the correct environment
which python
# Should show .venv/bin/python for main app
# Or .spert_env/bin/python for SpERT

# Reinstall dependencies if needed
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

**❌ SpaCy model missing**
```bash
# Install in SpERT environment
cd spert
source .spert_env/bin/activate
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

**❌ CUDA/GPU issues**
```bash
# Force CPU usage in SpERT config files
# Add this line to your .conf files:
cpu = true
```

**❌ Permission denied or command not found**
```bash
# On Windows, use:
.venv\Scripts\activate
.spert_env\Scripts\activate

# On Linux/Mac, ensure script permissions:
chmod +x .venv/bin/activate
```

**❌ Port already in use (browser mode)**
```bash
# Use different port
python -m textual serve app/app.py --port 8081
```

**❌ Configuration file errors**
- Ensure config files are in `spert/configs/`, not root `configs/`
- Use forward slashes in paths, even on Windows
- Check file paths exist relative to `spert/` directory

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the error message carefully
2. Ensure you're in the correct virtual environment
3. Verify all file paths in configuration files
4. Try running the application in different modes (browser vs terminal)
5. Check the application logs in `textual.log`

## Dependencies

### SpERT Environment (`.spert_env`)
SpERT manages its own dependencies including:
- PyTorch and Transformers
- BERT and other transformer models

### Optional Extensions
- **Coreference Resolution**: Install `requirements-coref.txt` for advanced NLP features
- **GPU Support**: CUDA-compatible PyTorch versions (configured in SpERT environment)

## Performance Tips

- **Use Browser Mode**: Generally faster and more responsive than terminal mode
- **Separate Environments**: Keeps dependencies isolated and prevents conflicts
- **GPU Training**: Configure CUDA in SpERT for faster model training
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple documents using the application's batch features
- **Memory Management**: Use smaller batch sizes if you encounter memory issues

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Model Integration
- Replace BERT with other transformer models in SpERT configs
- Experiment with different model architectures
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for your specific domain

### Data Pipeline Automation
- Use the application's scripting features for batch processing
- Integrate with external data sources
- Export results in various formats (JSON, CSV, CoNLL)

### Development and Extension
- Modify UI components in `app/components/`
- Add new preprocessing utilities in `app/utils/`
- Extend data models in `app/models/`
