# Optional NLP Dependencies for Advanced Coreference Resolution
# Install only what you need for your use case

# Base requirements (always needed for NLP processing)
spacy>=3.5.0
tqdm>=4.0.0

# === COREFERENCE RESOLUTION OPTIONS ===
# Choose ONE of the following options:

# Option 1: spaCy experimental (RECOMMENDED - stable and modern)
# spacy-experimental>=0.6.0

# Option 2: Stanza (advanced but can be memory-intensive)  
# stanza>=1.4.0

# Option 3: Transformers-based (experimental, requires GPU for best performance)
# transformers>=4.20.0
# torch>=1.12.0

# === INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ===
# 1. Install base requirements first:
#    pip install spacy>=3.5.0 tqdm>=4.0.0
#
# 2. Choose and install ONE coreference option:
#    - For spaCy experimental: pip install spacy-experimental>=0.6.0
#    - For Stanza: pip install stanza>=1.4.0  
#    - For Transformers: pip install transformers>=4.20.0 torch>=1.12.0
#
# 3. Download spaCy model:
#    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

# COMPATIBILITY NOTES:
# - neuralcoref is BROKEN on Python 3.11+ (do not use)
# - spacy-experimental is the most stable alternative
# - Stanza can be memory-intensive on large texts
# - Transformers option requires significant computational resources
